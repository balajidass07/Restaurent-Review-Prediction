# Restaurent-Review-Prediction

In this project, I have build a ML model using NLTK package for predicting restaurant review is positive. or not. Here i have used a restaurant review dataset which contains 1000 review. 

There are three basic steps for this project:
1.cleaning the text 
2.creating bag of words 
3.ML model using classifier. 

Also here i have used 5 classification model :
1.GaussenNB 
2.Decision tree 
3.Random Forest 
4.KNN 
5.Kernal SVM. 

Finally I have evaluated all models by Accuracy, Precision, Recall and F1 Score.
